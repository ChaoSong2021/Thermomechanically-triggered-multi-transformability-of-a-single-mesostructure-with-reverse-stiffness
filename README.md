Abstract:
Thermally triggered active metamaterials with shape memory polymers (SMPs) show greater potential for structural applications with reconfigurability than other programmable structures owing to their temporally stiff condition with shape locking. However, despite their excellent shape-locking property, most SMP-based active metamaterials have been described using simple single-modal deformation rather than multifaceted transformation, such as multimodal, multistep, or asymmetric deformation, because of the lack of an adequate method for an adaptable strategy and a reasonable mechanics model. Herein, we construct and demonstrate a thermomechanical tool that allows a single material system to transform with multimodal and asymmetric deformations. Using transformation aids (TAs), we conceive a localized prestress and a temperature-dependent reverse stiffness effect to exchange energy with a lattice. The deformation of a single SMP system whose energy is swapped from TAs by localized prestress and reverse stiffness can be transformed into multimodal and asymmetric deformations while maintaining the shape-locking property of the system. Our methods can be used for reconfigurable structures, tuning symmetry and chirality, especially for active acoustic metamaterials, deployable devices, and biomedical devices. The mechanics-inspired design approach of local deformation of TA and the interaction with the temperature-dependent stiffness drop of the lattice open an avenue to the robust design of thermally triggered active metamaterials.
